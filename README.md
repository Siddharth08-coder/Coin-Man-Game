# Coin-Man-Game
Android App which is basically a clone of famous game - "Super Mario Run"

The game is supported by an open source library: "Gdx Library" --> https://libgdx.com/ && https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/

The animation and rendering is achived throgh using a series of images which on playing on a contineous loop creates an illustration of a man Running. When screen is touched the man jumps to grab coin and create a score. If he interactes with BOMB he looses the game and the game is paused which then restarts when screen is touched again.

This app is developed by Siddharth Singh during his second semester while pursuaing B.TECH.

*NOTE:* The developer does not own any of the images, text and material used while creating this app. This app is a combination of various resources available over the internet.

Thank you.
Enjoy Coding!! :)
